The demo simply splits by time duration. See https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api/blob/master/nodejs/demo/test_srt.js for splitting based on word (while also getting the start & end time). Vosk lets you config recognizer to output words with times.

In `stt.js`:

- `speechToText_stream`: convert audio to the expected format and write to stdout, then vosk reads from stdout. Performed bad :(

- `speechToText_simple` expects the wav file to be 16bit, mono channel. Performed a bit better. Was able to parse the last sentence in `000010.wav` when max alternatives is set to 10 (but we cannot pick the closest one without listening to the audio anyway...)
